 A conceptual problem of the electric-field-mediated polarization correlations during a stochastic formation
 of polarization domain structure in ferroelectrics is addressed by using an exactly solvable stochastic model
 of polarization development in a uniaxial ferroelectric [Phys. Rev. B 107, 144109 (2023)]. A full set of
 time-dependent two-point correlation coefficients between all random variables is derived analytically, evaluated
 numerically, and presented graphically in three dimensions. They are particularly required for the analysis of
 nonlinear phenomena involving spatial dispersion like optical second harmonic generation and scattering.
